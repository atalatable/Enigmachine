# Enigmachine

You could have guessed with the name but this is a way to code messages way stronger than enigma could do (no). have fun trying it.

At that time I was still using french so good luck understanding (it's not that hard you can do it)

## Demo

### Menu

You have this cool green and black menu that will make you feel like a real H@ck3r.

1. Code
2. Decode
3. Leave
> Just press the number you want to use

### Coding

![code image](/images/img02.PNG)

1. Enter your keyword
2. Enter the message you want to code
3. Then copy either the first one `Le message code est :` if the other person already have the keyword
4. Else give him the `Le message code pour la communication est :`

### Decoding

Press 1 if you want to type type the keyword and then the coded message else type 2 and give the `message code pour la communication`

Here it's with the first method (1)

And here with the second (2) method

## Try it yourself

1. You need to be on a windows machine
2. Open your terminal
3. Clone repo with `git clone https://github.com/atalatable/Enigmachine.git`
4. Run `cd Enigmachine`
5. Either run the program `./main.exe` (But you should never trust anyone)
6. Or if you dont trust me, recompile it with `gcc main.c -o whateverName`
7. Then run the program with `./whateverName.exe`
8. Have fun speaking secretly with your friends that also have the program to decode your messages

> Carefull your terminal will stay green
